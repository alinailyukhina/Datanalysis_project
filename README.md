# About the project 
In this repository you can find our presentation and notebook dedicated to data analysis on the topic of representation of ex-colonies cultures at exhibitions of popular museums of the UK and Spain from 2014 to 2022. 
## Our research questions:
1) What objects types are the most exhibited in the museums of the UK and Spain from 2014 to 2022?
2) What regions are the most exhibited in the museums of the UK and Spain from 2014 to 2022?
3) Is there any correlation between museums, regions and objects types?
## Our hypotheses:
1) H0 - objects depend on the museums where they are exhibited, H1 - objects do not depend on the museums in which they are exhibited,
2) H0 - objects depend on the regions that are exhibited, H1 - objects do not depend on the regions they are exhibited,
3) H0 - regions depend on the museums where they exhibit, H1 - regions do not depend on the museums in which they are exhibited.
## Methods: 
1) Analysis of categorical data,
2) Correlation analysis,
3) Chi2.
